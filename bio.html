		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p>
			Ben grew up in Rockaway Beach, a neighborhood in the borough of Queens, NY. He went to high school at Brooklyn Technical High School, where he focused his studies on the biological sciences. Thinking that he would end up going to medical school in the future, Ben applied to Tufts University, a college which, he felt, would help him to build on his medical ambitions. Ultimately, Ben was admitted to Tufts as a QuestBridge scholar and, after a short run-in with college-level chemistry, decided that, perhaps, the path of medicine was not for him. After joining the Tufts Financial Group during his second semester at Tufts, Ben picked up an interest in finance pretty quickly, and felt that he should explore career opportunities within the financial services industry. Having decided to major in Economics, Ben felt that finance fit nicely within his major of choice, and began to teach himself whatever he could not learn in his classes. Three years and four internships later, Ben is excited to embark on a career in the industry, and has decided to focus on transactions-based roles in investment banking and private equity. To prepare for potential entrepreneurial endeavors in the future, Ben believes that attaining a base knowledge in Computer Science is essential. This belief has led him to take COMP11 (Intro to Computer Science) and, now, COMP20 (Web Programmng) while at Tufts. He is excited to see what the future holds after graduation!
